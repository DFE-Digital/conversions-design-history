Certain legal requirements need to be met for a conversions academy order (AO) to go ahead. These are:
 
1. The school has provided a governing body resolution. 
2. The governing body has consulted the relevant stakeholders. 
3. (If the school is linked to a diocese) the diocese consents to the proposed conversion. 
4. (If the school is supported by a foundation) the foundation consents to the proposed conversion. 

If these are not met, DfEâ€™s Judicial Review team can revert the AO because the correct process was not followed. 

## Meeting the requirements

Schools need to prove that the proposed academy conversion meets legal requirements when [applying to become an academy](https://apply-convert-academy.service.gov.uk/). They do this by uploading evidence such as consent letters. 

DfE delivery officers (DOs) ensure that schools have given the necessary information before [a decision is made](https://conversions-design-history.netlify.app/apply-to-become-academy/recording-a-decision/). 

To make this easy for DOs, we added a legal requirements section to the conversion project task list.

[![A digital task list. A link called legal requirements is highlighted.](/images/apply-to-become-academy/legal-requirements/legal-requirements-task-list.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/legal-requirements/confirm-legal-requirements.png)

We used the summary list component so that the section is consistent with other task list pages. DOs use radio buttons to confirm if the school has given the necessary information.

[![A summary list called Confirm legal requirements. It has four rows: governing body resolution, consultation, diocesan consent and foundation consent.](/images/apply-to-become-academy/legal-requirements/legal-requirements-task-list.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/legal-requirements/confirm-legal-requirements.png)

[![Has the school provided a governing body resolution? Yes, no, not applicable.](/images/apply-to-become-academy/recording-a-decision/added-a-record-the-decision-link-to-the-projects-list.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/recording-a-decision/governing-body-resolution.png)

We included a not applicable option because not all schools link to a diocese or are part of a foundation. We included not applicable in the other questions for consistency.

## Next steps

1. Test the legal requirements design with DOs 

2. Learn what happens currently when the DO selects no to the following options. 

- Governing body resolution 
- Consultation
