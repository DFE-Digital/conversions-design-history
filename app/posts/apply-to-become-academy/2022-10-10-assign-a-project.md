DfEâ€™s 9 regions consist of a list of authorities. Each authority has a team lead who is responsible for assigning [applications to become an academy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-conversion-application-forms)  to delivery officers (DO). 

Given team leads assign projects to DOs in the as-is process, it made sense to introduce a project assignment feature in our service.

## Understanding the problem
We collated our user research findings about assigning projects on a Lucidspark board.

[![A series of digital post-it notes about assigning an academy conversion project to delivery officers.](/images/apply-to-become-academy/assign-a-project/user-feedback.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/assign-a-project/user-feedback.png)

We then thought of possible solutions and problems with assigning projects in our service.

## Design provocations

We compared our notes with other project assignment designs in DfE.

[![Screenshots from the Complete conversions, transfers and changes service.](/images/apply-to-become-academy/assign-a-project/complete-service.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/assign-a-project/complete-service.png)

We also reflected on the as-is process for assigning projects to DOs.

Our interaction designer used these points of reference to create 2 design provocations:

1.	**Choose from a pre-populated list of DOs**. This was based on the designs of other DfE services, including our sister service Complete conversions, transfers and changes.

[![Screenshots of option 1, choose from a list of delivery officers.](/images/apply-to-become-academy/assign-a-project/option-1.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/assign-a-project/option-1.png)

2.	**Enter the email address of the assigned DO.** This would save time updating a list of DOs when someone leaves, for example.

[![Screenshots of option 2, offline communications + entering email address. Continue doing the as-is process for assigning projects.](/images/apply-to-become-academy/assign-a-project/option-2.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/assign-a-project/option-2.png)

We discussed the 2 options as a team and considered the pros and cons of each one.

This prompted a follow-on discussion about how we would maintain a list of users. We considered different approaches and the implications of each approach.

## Prototype design

We created a prototype design considering everything that we discussed as a team. We then tested our prototype with team leads.

### Next steps

We will test our prototype with delivery officers in user research sessions.
