DfEâ€™s 9 regions consist of a list of authorities. Each authority has a team lead who is responsible for assigning [applications to become an academy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-conversion-application-forms)  to delivery officers (DO). 

Given team leads assign projects to DOs in the as-is process, it made sense to introduce a project assignment feature in our service.

## Design provocations
We collated our user research findings about assigning projects on a Lucidspark board. We then thought of possible solutions and problems with assigning projects in our service.

[![A series of post it note questions about assigning projects.](/images/apply-to-become-academy/assign-a-project/ideas.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/assign-a-project/ideas.png)

We compared our notes with other project assignment designs in DfE, as well as the as-is process.

Our interaction designer used this to create and present 2 design provocations:

1.	Choose from a pre-populated list of DOs. This was based on the designs of other DfE services, including our sister service Complete conversions, transfers and changes.
2.	Enter the email address of the assigned DO. This would save time updating a list of DOs when someone leaves, for example.

[![Screenshots of two options: 1, choose from a list of delivery officers; 2, offline communications and entering email address (the as-is process).](/images/apply-to-become-academy/assign-a-project/provocations.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/assign-a-project/provocations.png)

We discussed the 2 approaches as a team and considered the pros and cons of each one.

This prompted a follow-on discussion about how we would maintain a list of users. We considered all possible ways we could maintain this list and the pros and cons of each approach.

## Prototype design

We created a prototype design considering everything that we discussed as a team. We then tested our prototype with team leads.

### Next steps

We will test our prototype with delivery officers in user research sessions.
