    parent: Manage an academy conversion
---

Our service helps create strong schools where children can thrive and teachers can prosper.

It's an efficient and unified end-to-end service that will support schools becoming academies and the DfE staff that manage these academy conversions.

The benefits of our service will include:
- giving clarity and guidance to schools and trusts at every stage of the process
- simplifying and standardising the process for the Regional Delivery Directorate (RDD) and the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA)
- enabling Regional school's commissioners (RSCs) and Advisory Board members to make confident, informed, decisions backed up by trustworthy data
- giving the wider DfE the data they need to track and report on the conversion landscape
