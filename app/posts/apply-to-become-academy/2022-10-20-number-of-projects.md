The all projects heading on our conversions project list is currently in this format: **All projects (number of projects on the page)**. 

For example: All projects (12).

[![A list of academy conversion projects. It has a subheading called All projects (10).](/images/apply-to-become-academy/number-of-projects/all-projects.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/number-of-projects/all-projects.png)

[![A list of academy conversion projects. Page one of 2.](/images/apply-to-become-academy/number-of-projects/page-one.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/number-of-projects/page-one.png)

We felt that this format would mislead new users into thinking there are 12 projects in our service, not on the page. 

## Meeting user need

>As a novice delivery officer
>I need to make sure I don't miss anything
>So that I can progress the project correctly

To meet this user need and avoid misleading new users, we changed the project count format to: **(number of projects in the service) projects found**. 

For example: 12 projects found.

[![A list of academy conversion projects. 12 projects found.](/images/apply-to-become-academy/number-of-projects/12-projects.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/number-of-projects/12-projects.png)

When users filter projects, the number of projects found is updated. 

For example: 4 projects found.

[![A list of filtered academy conversion projects. 4 projects found.](/images/apply-to-become-academy/number-of-projects/4-projects.png)](/images/apply-to-become-academy/number-of-projects/4-projects.png)

## Next steps

Monitor in user research whether the number of projects found format makes sense to new delivery officers.
