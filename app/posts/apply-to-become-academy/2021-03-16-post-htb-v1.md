## Design

The first version of the post HTB prototype started as another static Figma file. This click-through allowed us to quickly update and explain to the team our new thoughts and learnings.

Although we know we still need to learn more, doing this desk research helped us put together an initial concept to put in front of our SMEs and users to start that process.

Once we put together our intial designs, we asked our subject matter experts (SMEs) to give their input.

They helped us refine the design with:

- links to the important documents they need access to
- updating the reference number to reflect the school's URN number
- including task that we'd missed like creating a new URN and handing over to the ESFA
- adding the project notes section we already had in the pre HTB designs
- removing some tags on the dashboard that wouldn't make sense to delivery officers

Overall, our SMEs were happy with the desings and said they looked easy to use and also remove the need to do things over email.
